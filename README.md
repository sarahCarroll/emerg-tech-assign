Assignment for Emerging Technology 2018

## Running Jupyter Notebooks
1. Download Anaconda. [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Clone repository, git clone https://github.com/sarahCarroll/emerg-tech-assign.git
3. Navigate to emerg-tech-assign specified location using the command prompt.
4. Run command "jupyter notebook".
5. Wait and the jupyter notebook will open in the browser and it is possible to view all notebook and python script.

## Running Python Script
1. Download Anaconda. [link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. Clone repository, git clone https://github.com/sarahCarroll/emerg-tech-assign.git
3. Navigate to emerg-tech-assign specified location using the command prompt.
4. Run command "python digitrec.py".

### NumPy Random.ipynb
* This notebook breaks down the numpy random package showing the most useful packages within it for software Development
* I go into detail on the numpy.random , numpy.arrange, numpy.array libraries.
* I also use basic mathplot lib to display some graphs.

### iris-dataset.ipynb
* This notebook explains the iris dataset. 
* To help explain it I use numpy, mathplotlib and pandas. In addition I create a simple neural network using tensorflow to determine which type of fower a given sample is.

### MNIST-dataset.ipynb
* This notebook looks at the basic concept of the mnist dataset and get a better understanding how it is broken down.
* I use numpy and mathplotlib to display images and read label file.
* I also save the images locally to my machine.

### digitrec.py
* This is a python Script which trains a neural network to determine what digit is input.
* I use the mnsit dataset to  train this network.
* I use the Mnist dataset (test files) to test the network.



### digit-recognition.ipynb
*This is a dataset to explain exactly the steps and design decisions made when creating the digitrec.py file
